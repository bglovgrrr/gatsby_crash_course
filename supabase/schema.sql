-- Side B: full database setup in one file (the same as supabase/migrations/ combined).
-- Use it for a brand-new Supabase project: SQL Editor → New query → paste → Run.
-- Safe to run more than once. Schema changes from now on go in supabase/migrations/.
--
-- How it works:
--   * Players sign in anonymously (no accounts). Their auth user id is their player id.
--   * Each game is one row in `rooms`; the whole game state lives in `state` (JSON).
--   * `room_members` says who is in which room. Row-level security means you can only
--     see and change rooms you are a member of.
--   * You become a member only through create_room() or join_room() (with the code).
