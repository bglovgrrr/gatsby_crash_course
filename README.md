# Side B

**Every song has a story.**

Side B is a relaxed music game for 2–8 friends in the same room. Someone asks a question, everyone secretly answers with a song, and then you listen to each one together and talk about why it was picked.

> **Status:** in development. Demo mode and online rooms work. The database is live on Supabase; the app isn't hosted yet.

## How a game works

1. **Ask.** The asker writes a question or picks one from a theme, such as *"What song reminds you of your dad?"*
2. **Pick.** Everyone searches for a song on their own phone and locks it in. Picks stay secret, and you can add a short note about why.
3. **Listen & talk.** Songs are revealed one at a time and play on the host's phone, hooked up to a speaker. Anyone can play, pause, or skip. After each song, the person who picked it tells the story.
4. **Next round.** The next person asks. When you're done, the recap shows every round's mixtape.

## Features

- **No accounts.** Start a game and friends scan the QR code (or enter the 4-letter code) and join with just a name.
- **Guess who picked it** (optional). Everyone guesses whose song is playing before the reveal. 1 point per correct guess.
- **Pick timer** (optional). 60s, 90s, or 2 min; listening starts automatically when time's up.
- **Reactions.** Tap ❤️ 😂 😭 🔥 🙌 while a song plays and they float up on every screen.
- **Song of the round.** Vote for your favourite after each round; the winner gets a crown.
- **Group selfies.** Snap a selfie after any round; it's saved privately with the game, shown as polaroids in the recap, and added to the recap card.
- **Recap card.** A shareable image of the night's mixtape.
- **Save to Spotify.** Turn the whole game into a playlist (needs a Spotify app; see below).
- **Gentle chimes.** A soft sound when it's your turn to ask, when picking starts, and when 10 seconds are left.
- **Live sync.** Every phone stays in step: questions, picks, play/pause, and the progress bar.
- **Rejoin anytime.** Refresh or lock your phone and you land back in the same game.
- **Question themes.** Throwback, Family, Love & heartbreak, Hype, Deep cuts, Places, and Wildcard, plus your own questions and "Surprise me".
- **Song search with previews.** Uses iTunes search with 30-second clips. No API key needed.
- **Demo mode.** Play a full game on one device with three bot friends.
- **Made for phones and desktops.** Light, dark, or match-device theme. You can add it to your home screen like an app.

## Getting started

Requires Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:5173
npm run dev -- --host  # also open it on your phone (same Wi-Fi)
npm run build          # production build in dist/
npm test               # automated tests (game rules + online sync)
npm run lint
```

### Tests

`npm test` runs the automated tests with Vitest:

- `src/game/engine.test.ts` covers every game rule: joining, turns, picks, playback, rounds, and leaving.
- `src/game/online-client.test.ts` simulates several phones against a stand-in for Supabase, including two people tapping at the same moment and reactions.
- `src/music/spotify.test.ts` checks the Spotify export against a stand-in for Spotify's API.

GitHub runs lint, type check, tests, and a build on every push (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). The result shows as ✅ or ❌ next to each commit.

Online play reads the Supabase project from `.env`. The publishable key in that file is meant to be public; the database's row-level security rules control access.

## Putting it online

Friends need a web address to join. Any static host works. The easiest free option is **Vercel**:

1. Sign in at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) with GitHub.
2. Choose **Add New → Project** and import this repository.
3. Keep the detected settings (Vite, `npm run build`, output `dist`) and deploy.

Vercel deploys the repository's default branch, so merge your work there first, or pick a different production branch in the project settings.

## Save to Spotify (optional)

1. Create an app at [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard). Choose **Web API**.
2. Add your site's address as a **Redirect URI**, with the trailing slash (for example `https://your-app.vercel.app/`). For local testing add `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` and open the app at that address (Spotify doesn't accept `localhost`).
3. Put the app's **Client ID** in `.env` as `VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` (it is not a secret). On Vercel, add it under **Settings → Environment Variables** too.
4. Under **User Management**, add the Spotify account of everyone who will save playlists.

Spotify restricts apps in Development Mode: the app owner needs Spotify Premium, and only listed users can sign in. Since Spotify's February 2026 changes, some developers report that playlist creation is refused for Development Mode apps. If that happens, the app explains the error and **Copy song list** still works.

## Backend (Supabase)

The project uses Supabase's free tier for live rooms.

| What | How |
| --- | --- |
| Sign-in | Anonymous. Each device gets a player id with no account needed. Turn on **Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Allow anonymous sign-ins**. |
| Games | One row per game in `rooms`, with the whole game state stored as JSON. |
| Security | Row-level security means you can only read or change games you joined. Players can only join through the `create_room` and `join_room` functions. |
| Conflicts | Every save checks a version number, so two people tapping at once can't overwrite each other. |
| Live updates | Supabase Realtime, plus a server clock sync so progress bars match. |
| Selfies | Private Storage bucket `selfies`. Files live in a folder named after the room, and only that room's players can upload, view (short-lived signed links) or delete them. Photos are shrunk to 1600px JPEG before upload. |

**Database changes** live in [`supabase/migrations/`](supabase/migrations). The Supabase GitHub integration applies new migrations when they reach the production branch. To set up a brand-new project in one go, paste [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql) into **SQL Editor → New query** and press **Run**.

**Free tier:** Supabase pauses a free project after a week without use. Open the dashboard and press **Restore** to wake it.

## Project structure

```
src/
  game/
    engine.ts          All game rules in one pure function: reduce(state, action, player)
    types.ts           Players, rounds, picks, playback
    prompts.ts         Question themes
    client.ts          How screens talk to a game (demo or online)
    local-client.ts    Demo mode with bot players
    online-client.ts   Online mode: Supabase rooms, realtime, versioned saves
  screens/             One screen per phase: lobby, asking, picking, listening, between, recap
  components/          Shared game UI, audio player, and shadcn/ui components (ui/)
  music/               Song search and the offline song list
  hooks/               useGame, useTheme
  lib/                 Supabase client, clock sync, helpers
supabase/
  migrations/          Database changes, in order
  schema.sql           Full setup for a new project
```

To change how the game plays, start in `src/game/engine.ts`. Demo and online modes use the same rules.

## Built with

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| App | Vite, React 19, TypeScript |
| UI | Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, Motion, Lucide icons |
| Brand | Pastel palette with Fraunces and Figtree fonts (bundled). Colours are tokens in `src/index.css` |
| Backend | Supabase (Postgres, anonymous auth, Realtime) |
| Music | iTunes Search API. Spotify is planned |
| Install | PWA via `vite-plugin-pwa` |

Add more shadcn components with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`.

## Working on it with Claude Code

- `.mcp.json` connects Claude Code to the Supabase project. On first use, run `/mcp`, choose **supabase**, then **Authenticate**.
- Supabase's agent skills are in `.claude/skills/`.
- `npm run build:preview` makes a single-file demo build in `dist-preview/`, for previewing inside the Claude app (`node scripts/claude-preview.mjs` prepares it for publishing).

## Roadmap
